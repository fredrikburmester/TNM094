# Particle System
> TNM094 Lab 2

This lab was about creating a particle system. There's a lot of different ways to program this but the main takeaway is learning where do store data, how to share logic between classes and stuff like that.  

Look at the header files and how i've structured the classes. You don't have to to it the same way but my way is one way haha.
